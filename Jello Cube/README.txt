================

Please use as "520-S14-JelloCube.exe worldfile [EnableGeometryAndMouseDrag = 1]"

Implemented following as basic requirement :
	Calculation of different kinds of spring force and making a stable jello cube.
	Collision detection and resolution. Implemented collision springs with collision against bounding box.
	Checked for force field and calculated the force field amount on each particle.
	Collected JPEG images for animation.

Implemented following for extra credit :
	Implemented inclined plane collision detection and resolution. Drawn plane with varying point of contact(involving ordering of points in CCW order)
	Implemented collision detection and resolution with cylinder.
	Implemented collision detection and resolution with sphere.
	Dragging the mouse adds external force to the whole cube in the direction of mouse drag(which involved retrieval of world coordinates from model coordinates)
	
Other Features:
	Pressing 'j' pauses the animation and then we can move forward with each frame by pressing j.
	Added Windows queryPerformance counter can be activated/deactivated by pressing 'o'. Shows on the console.
